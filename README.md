# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on movie reviews using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
It applies text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning models to classify reviews as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**.

---

## Overview

This notebook explores three feature extraction techniques and two machine learning algorithms:

### Feature Extraction:
1. **Bag of Words (BoW)**
2. **Word2Vec Embeddings**
3. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**

### Models Used:
- **Multinomial Logistic Regression**
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**

The project includes text cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, normalization, and visual evaluation through confusion matrices and performance metrics.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Dataset: `MovieReviews_Augmented.csv`  
   - Review texts labeled as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.  
   - Text normalization and cleaning using NLTK.

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)  
   - Word2Vec Embeddings (Google News vectors)  
   - TF-IDF (TfidfVectorizer)

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**  
   - Trained **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes** on each representation.  
   - Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.
